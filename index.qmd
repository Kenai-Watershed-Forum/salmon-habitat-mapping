::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
Less than half of Alaska's freshwater salmon habitat is officially documented by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, and until these streams and lakes are inventoried they will not be protected under Alaska state law.

Two nonprofits in the central Kenai Peninsula region, Kenai Watershed Forum and the Kenai Peninsula Chapter of Trout Unlimited, are collaborating to address this data gap by working with volunteers to document local salmon habitat. From 2021 - 2023, we identified 17.5 miles of stream and 1152 lake acres of previously undocumented anadromous habitat in areas within a thirty minute drive of Soldotna, Alaska.

Given that so much undocumented salmon habitat was so close at hand prior to this project, our results highlight the need to continue this work and strengthen connections between habitat research and habitat management. Going forward in summer 2024, we are working with map specialists to apply predictive habitat occupancy models that will help to target and prioritize our fieldwork. If these models prove successful, we anticipate that in the future they may have broad application throughout Alaska and within regulatory and permitting regimes.
