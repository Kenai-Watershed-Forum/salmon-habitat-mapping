## Fish capture

During fieldwork in summers 2021 - 2024:

-   Over course of `r n_days` fieldwork days 2021 - 2024 (including the training event), we conducted a total of `r n_events` sampling events at `r n_sites_total` unique sites. See the interactive project map in the Methods section ("Site selection") for a current map of where nominations have occurred. 

-   Table @tbl-sites summarises total sampling events by individual site. We typically sampled a site only one time each.

-   We have captured `r fish_ct` fish comprised of `r spp_ct` unique species. Table @tbl-ct-spp summarizes current fish capture count by species.

-   Table @tbl-site-spp-ct summarizes total fish capture for each species by site.

```{r echo = F}
#| label: tbl-sites
#| tbl-cap: "Site visit count 2021 - 2024"

n_sites_coords %>%
  kbl(caption = "Total site visits") %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria") %>%
  scroll_box(height = "500px", width = "350px")

# export csv
write.csv(n_sites_coords,"output/site_visits_coords.csv", row.names = F)

## AWC Nominations

Fish capture data was evaluated against the 2024 Anadromous Waters Catalog to identify new stream segment nominations. Complete submission materials for 2021 - 2023 may be accessed in the project [Google Drive folder (link)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UmQGruxbmRO-ICCd0xbGi5rPp1ZTFCX2?usp=drive_link), sent to the ADF&G Habitat Division in Anchorage in the fall of each year. In 2024 we submitted all nominations through the Fish Map App smartphone application from the Alaska Conservation Foundation

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Total Anadromous Waters Nominations

As of October 2024, a total length of **21.1 miles** of stream segments and **173 lake acres** were included in our 23 nominations.
:::

Tables @tbl-awc-noms and @tbl-awc-noms-lakes below breaks down each stream segment nomination by length and lake by area.

```{r echo = F}
#| label: tbl-awc-noms
#| tbl-cap: "Lengths of stream segments included in anadromous waters nominations."

### nomination records
noms_tbl <- read_excel("input/2021_2024_stream_lengths.xlsx") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  select(nomination,nomination_name,shape_length) %>%
  # convert from m to km
  mutate(shape_length = shape_length/1000) %>%
  rename(stream_length_km = shape_length) %>%
  filter(!is.na(nomination_name)) %>%
  group_by(nomination_name, nomination) %>%
  summarise(total_stream_length_km = sum(stream_length_km)) %>%
  arrange(nomination)

# stream table
noms_tbl %>%
  kbl(caption = "AWC Stream Nominations 2021 - 2024", digits = 2) %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")

```

For general background on nominations, see the [slides linked here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uQX9_4T-vJDzp_gzBJFyqtggOg1Fpsng?rtpof=true&usp=drive_fs), presented at Kenai Watershed Forum's Fireside Chat series held at Kenai River Brewing on November 1, 2023.

## Volunteer participation

Volunteer recruitment efforts resulted in a steadily increasing level of participation from the general public. A total of 350 volunteer hours were documented throughout the project, with an initial higher outlay in 2021 to initiate training.

<br>

```{r echo = F}
# volunteer hours prep
vol_hrs <- read_sheet(url, sheet = "hours_records") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  select(year,training_vs_fieldwork,total_time_hours) %>%
  group_by(year,training_vs_fieldwork) %>%
  summarise(hrs = sum(total_time_hours)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(hrs))

# plot
vol_hrs %>%
  ggplot(aes(as.character(year),hrs,fill = training_vs_fieldwork)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Volunteer Hours") +
  theme(legend.title=element_blank()) +
  ggtitle("Central Kenai Peninsula Salmon Habitat Mapping\nVolunteer Hours 2021-2024")

```

The level of volunteer participation, along with experience gained, closely tracked the quantity of nominations submitted each year, with a steadily rising number of nominations from 2021 to 2023. 2024 saw very minimal fudning resources directed towards fieldwork, thus the number of volunteer hours declined. Despite this reduced funding in 2024, six nominations were submitted. The result speaks to how sustained financial support, even if fluctuating in amount, is important to keep projects such as this in progress.

# plot
noms_tbl %>%
  group_by(nomination) %>%
  tally() %>%
  ggplot(aes(nomination,n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Number of AWC Nominations Submitted") +
  ggtitle("Number of Anadromous Waters Nominations\nSubmitted to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game\n2021 - 2024")

## Aquatic Resource Permit

Fish capture data was reformatted each fall in to a csv file for submission to ADF&G in fulfillment of the required [Aquatic Resource Permit](http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=otherlicense.aquatic_reports)[^results-1]; available in the online in [this project's GitHub repo](https://github.com/Kenai-Watershed-Forum/tu_awc_expansion/tree/main/output)[^results-2].
